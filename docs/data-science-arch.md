# Reference - Data Science Architectures

This are helpful reference diagrams for those curious about what a data science architecture looks like for different scenarios.

I chose to reference Amazon Web Services for these designs, but Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform also have similar, if not equivalent, offerings.
