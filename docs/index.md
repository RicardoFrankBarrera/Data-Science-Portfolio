## Welcome!

I'm a Program Manager and Data Scientist and I've created this page for a few reasons:

1. Highlight what I've done professionally,
2. Educate others on how effective and impactful Data Science is,
3. Solidify my knowledge

I believe I only truly understand something once I'm able to teach it to someone else, so writing this out helps ensure I know what I'm talking about.


In my GitHub, you'll find:

* My latest and greatest resume,
* One-pagers describing the high-level overview (goals, approach, impact, and lessons) of some work I've done in my previous roles,
* Code I've written for various projects, and
* Data science projects I've developed and models I've trained

#### @My Startup: Real Estate Investment Recommendation System

Play with my deep-learning neural net and see what it thinks of a home you present it with.

This project was inspired by some basic tooling I created for myself as a real-estate investor to automate my search and analysis process. Real-estate investment has a lot of subjectivity and nuance, and data is sparse, limited, inconsistent
