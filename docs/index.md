## Welcome!

I'm Ricardo Frank Barrera, a Program Manager and Data Scientist and this is my GitHub Page. I have experience managing teams large (20+) and small (me) but I'll be focusing this page on my Data Science projects. Though this page is meant to highlight some of what I've done professionally, I hope it educates others on how impactful, broadly applicable, and approachable Data Science is to most businesses.

In here and in my GitHub repository, you'll find:

* My latest and greatest [resume](https://github.com/RicardoFrankBarrera/Professional-Portfolio/blob/main/Resume/Ricardo%20Frank%20Barrera%20-%202021%20Resume%20(Beautiful).pdf),
* Write-ups regarding professional projects I've done, specifically describing the context along with a high-level overview (e.g., goals, approach, impact, and lessons),
* Code I've written for various projects, 
* Data science projects I've developed and models I've trained

Thanks for stopping by!

Ricardo
