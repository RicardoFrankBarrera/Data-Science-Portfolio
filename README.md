# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

Chances are you've stumbled upon this because I directed you here, or you're researching me for some reason. Take a look around, read through my principles (listed below 👇), and [let me know if you have any questions](mailto:ricardofrankbarrera@gmail.com). I look forward to working with you!

Also, I built a [GitHub Page](https://ricardofrankbarrera.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/) that is far more approachable to look at that my repository. In this repository, you'll find my resume, one-pagers of work done, and examples of programming and data science projects I've worked on. In the GitHub Page, you'll find a far more detailed explanation of each project, the context, thought-process throughout the project, and so on.

## `My Principles`

### 🗣 Communication is everything
I do not tolerate lousy communication and will insist upon clear and respectful communication at all times from anyone I work with, regardless of how smart or mission-critical they may be. Any endeavor worth striving for requires a cohesive team, and a team falls apart when communication breaks down.

### ✅ Integrity over ego
I care about doing the right thing even if it isn't in my best interest, and see this as a core value for any team to achieve long-term success.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Relentlessly ask questions
Innovation means constantly standing at the boundary of the known and the unknown. We must ask questions to constantly push that boundary. Also, life is so much more fun when approached with a child-like curiosity.

### 📊 Bring data to opinion fights
Tossing out an opinion and stubbornly standing by it without anything to back it up is foolish. I will 



### 🗣 Communication is everything, especially in open-source.
If you can't communicate your findings or collaborate with others, your career will be over before it begins. Science and engineering are team sports. Any successful open-source project will have a strong emphasis on communication, collaboration, empathy, and respect - not just engineering. [A thread](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/945702102214594560).

### 📈 Choose growth opportunities.
"Try never to be the smartest person in the room. And if you are, I suggest you invite smarter people… or find a different room." Always choose an opportunity to learn, to grow new skills. [Always](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1050126083863924736).

### 👭 Nurture and build communities.
Communities are powerful, fragile things and must be nurtured over time. Be kind; have empathy; respect differing paces. **Everything** is about the community: making it collaborative, caring; a collective. A group of passionate people who care about each other's success. If you can build this, you can build anything.

### 📃 If you don't have documentation, you don't have a minimum viable product.
Am so impressed by the level of care and effort each [@docsmsft](https://docs.microsoft.com) article, tutorial, quickstart, etc. receives before it's pushed to production. It's a commitment to empathy and respect: welcoming people at whatever level they are, and patiently helping them move up to the next level. Docs are a developer's first impression of your product. Make them awesome.

### 🎁 Give without expecting a return.
[Someone very wise](http://third-bit.com/) once told me that throughout a career, you'll meet people — and you'll help, support, and encourage them, not even thinking about it. But those influences _will_ change lives; and if you're lucky, you'll find out later.

### 🙏 Believe in people, not acronyms.
[This year](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/984584446316703746) was the first time I'd ever heard the phrase "_PhD or GTFO_", and I don't believe I've ever been more nauseated. Acronyms don't equate to worth, or industriousness, or character. Have met many brilliant folks without a degree; and PhD's without creativity, empathy, or work ethic. I'll choose the former, every time.
