# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

Chances are you've stumbled upon this because I directed you here, or you're researching me for some reason. Take a look around, read through my principles (listed below 👇), and [let me know if you have any questions](mailto:ricardofrankbarrera@gmail.com). I look forward to working with you!

Also, I built a [GitHub Page](https://ricardofrankbarrera.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/) that is far more approachable to look at that my repository. In this repository, you'll find my resume, one-pagers of work done, and examples of programming and data science projects I've worked on. In the GitHub Page, you'll find a far more detailed explanation of each project, the context, thought-process throughout the project, and so on.

## `My Principles`

### 🗣 Communication is everything
I do not tolerate lousy communication and will insist upon clear and respectful communication at all times from anyone I work with, regardless of how smart or mission-critical they may be. Any endeavor worth striving for requires a cohesive team, and a team falls apart when communication breaks down.

### ✅ Integrity over ego
I care about doing the right thing even if it isn't in my best interest, and see this as a core value for any team to achieve long-term success.

### 🏠 Nurture and build communities
Community exist in many forms (e.g., a team at work, friends in the neighborhood, a discussion group online), and flourish or die based upon culture which is very fragile and much be nurtured carefully. Be kind, patient, empathetic, supportive, and selfless, and push others to do the same.

### 📈 Choose growth opportunities
I believe in being perpetually but manageably uncomfortable, taking on new challenges and intentionally breaking routine. It has served me well so far, and I think it's humbling to intentionally stay a novice rather than sitting comfortably on experience and expertise. 

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Relentlessly ask questions
Innovation means constantly standing at the boundary of the known and the unknown. We must ask questions to constantly push that boundary. Also, life is so much more fun when approached with a child-like curiosity.

### 📊 Bring data to opinion fights
The weight of an opinion should be proportional to the weight of the evidence backing it; the speaker's seniority, convinction, or skill with words take a backseat to the data. Some of the best ideas I've heard have come from uncertain junior team-members, and some of the worst ideas I've heard have come from an overly confident expert.

### 📃 If you don't have documentation, you don't have a minimum viable product.
It's a commitment to empathy and respect: welcoming people at whatever level they are, and patiently helping them move up to the next level. Docs are a developer's first impression of your product. Make them awesome.

### 🎁 Give without expecting a return.
The selfless mentality is key for a team to achieve its potential. The best teams I've worked on were led by amazing people who embodied this every single day.

### 🙏 Believe in people, not acronyms.
I don't put much weight behind credentials or accolades, as some of the smartest and most capable people I've met didn't have stellar credentials or amazing accolades to their name. This reminds me of a saying I live by when recruiting and interviewing candidates: "you can fix skill gaps, but you can't fix character flaws"
